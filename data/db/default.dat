Type:
  name: Vodka
  description: Vodka is a distilled beverage composed primarily of water and ethanol, 
    sometimes with traces of impurities and flavorings. Traditionally, vodka is made by 
    the distillation of fermented grains or potatoes, though some modern brands use other 
    substances, such as fruits or sugar.
Type:
  name: Gin
  description: Gin is a spirit which derives its predominant flavour from juniper berries 
    (Juniperus communis). From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved over 
    the course of a millennium from a herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits 
    industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older Jenever, and become widely popular 
    in Great Britain when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the British 
    throne with his wife Mary. Today, the gin category is one of the most popular and widely 
    distributed range of spirits, and is represented by products of various origins, styles, 
    and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.
Type:
  name: Whisky
  description: Whisky or whiskey is a type of distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented 
    grain mash. Different grains are used for different varieties, including barley, malted barley, 
    rye, malted rye, wheat, buckwheat and corn. Whisky is typically aged in wooden casks, made 
    generally of charred white oak.
Type:
  name: Bourbon
  description: Bourbon whiskey is a type of American whiskey: a barrel-aged distilled spirit made 
    primarily from corn. The name is ultimately derived from the French Bourbon dynasty, although 
    it is disputed whether the namesake Kentucky county or New Orleans street inspired the whiskey's name. 
    Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. The name "Bourbon" was not applied until the 1820s, 
    and the Kentucky etymology was not advanced until the 1870s. While the liquor may be made anywhere in 
    the United States, it is strongly associated with the American South in general, and Kentucky in particular.
Type:
  name: Scotch
  description: Scotch whisky, often simply called Scotch, is malt whisky or grain whisky made in Scotland. 
    All Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial distilleries began introducing whisky 
    made from wheat and rye in the late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct categories: 
    single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky, blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called "vatted 
    malt" or "pure malt"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch whisky. 
Type:
  name: Rum
  description: Rum is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from sugarcane byproducts, such as molasses, or 
    directly from sugarcane juice, by a process of fermentation and distillation. The distillate, a clear 
    liquid, is then usually aged in oak barrels. Rum can be referred to in Spanish by descriptors such as 
    ron viejo ("old rum") and ron añejo ("aged rum").
Type:
  name: Spiced Rum
  description: Spiced rums obtain their flavors through the addition of spices and, sometimes, caramel. Most 
    are darker in color, and based on gold rums. Some are significantly darker, while many cheaper brands are 
    made from inexpensive white rums and darkened with caramel color. Among the spices added are cinnamon, 
    rosemary, absinthe/aniseed, or pepper.
Type:
  name: Tequila
  description: Tequila is a regional specific name for a distilled beverage made from the blue agave plant, 
    primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Guadalajara, and in 
    the highlands (Los Altos) of the north western Mexican state of Jalisco. Although tequila is a kind of 
    mezcal, modern tequila differs somewhat in the method of its production, in the use of only blue agave 
    plants, as well as in its regional specificity.
Type:
  name: Vermouth
  description: Vermouth is an aromatized fortified wine flavored with various botanicals (roots, barks, 
    flowers, seeds, herbs, spices). The modern versions of the beverage were first produced in the mid to 
    late 18th century in Turin, Italy.
Type:
  name: Amaretto
  description: Amaretto is a sweet, almond-flavoured, Italian liqueur. It is made from a base of apricot 
    pits or almonds, sometimes both.
Type:
  name: Coffee Liqueur
  description: Coffee is a great flavor for cocktails and mixed drinks and can be added in a variety of 
    ways. Whether it be hot coffee, chilled espresso, a coffee liqueur or one of the newer espresso-infused 
    vodkas, these cocktails all include the great taste of java and are fun to explore.

  name: Amaretto Sour
  glasstype: Old Fashined Glass
  description: The Amaretto Sour belongs to a family of mixed drinks known as – you guessed it – 
    “sours.” These cocktail recipes are defined by having at least one liquor (or liqueur), lemon 
    or lime juice and a bit of sweetener. They include classics like the Margarita, Sidecar and 
    Whiskey Sour. The smooth, sweet taste and mild kick of an Amaretto Sour makes it ideal for 
    occasional drinkers as well as more dedicated cocktail fans.
  instructions: @1 Shake the amaretto, lemon juice and teaspoon of granulated sugar in a strainer without ice
                @2 Strain into a glass over ice
                @3 Garnish with a maraschino cherry

  name: Black Russian
  glasstype: Old Fashioned Glass
  description: The Black Russian supposedly appeared in Brussels in 1949. It’s a wonderfully simple cocktail – 
    just vodka and Kahlua over ice. This is one of the easiest recipes for tinkering: try a different coffee 
    liqueur, or a flavored vodka (vanilla is great), add a splash of cola, use equal amounts of vodka and 
    liqueur, or you can even add a scoop of chocolate ice cream into this drink.
